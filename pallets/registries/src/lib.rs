//! # Registries Pallet
//!
//! The Registries pallet provides a framework for creating and managing
//! isolated registries within the CORD blockchain that can be governed and
//! moderated with a fine-grained permission system. It allows for the creation,
//! changing the status of the registry, as well as the management of delegates
//! within these registry.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Registry pallet allows for the creation of distinct registry on the CORD
//! blockchain, each with its own set of rules and governance. These registry can
//! be used to manage different ecosystems or communities within the larger
//! blockchain environment. Registry are created with a unique identifier and can
//! be managed by appointed delegates.
//!
//! ## Interface
//!
//! The pallet provides dispatchable functions for registry management:
//!
//! - `create`: Initializes a new registry with a unique identifier.
//! - `update`: Updates the existing registry with newer data.
//! - `revoke`: Marks a registry as revoked, effectively changing it to revoked status.
//! - `reinstate`: Changes the status of the registry, returning it to active status.
//! - `archive`: Marks a registry as archived, effectively changing it to archived status.
//! - `restore`: Changes the status of the registry, returning it to non-archival status.
//! - `add_delegate`: Adds a delegate to a registry, granting them specific permissions.
//! - `add_admin_delegate`: Adds an admin delegate to a registry, granting them administrative
//!   permissions.
//! - `add_audit_delegate`: Adds an audit delegate to a registry, granting them audit permissions.
//! - `remove_delegate`: Removes a delegate from a registry, revoking their permissions.
//!
//!
//! ## Permissions
//!
//! The pallet uses a permissions system to manage the actions that delegates
//! can perform within a registry. Permissions are granular and can be assigned to
//! different roles, such as an admin or a regular delegate.
//!
//! ## Data Privacy
//!
//! The Registries pallet is designed with data privacy as a core consideration.
//! It does not directly store any personal or sensitive information on-chain.
//! Instead, it manages references to off-chain data, ensuring that the
//! blockchain layer remains compliant with data privacy regulations. Users and
//! developers are responsible for ensuring that the off-chain data handling
//! processes adhere to the applicable laws and standards.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! The Registries pallet can be used by other pallets ex. Entries pallet to create
//! compartmentalized and governed sections of the blockchain. This is
//! particularly useful for applications that require distinct governance models
//! or privacy settings within a shared ecosystem.
//!
//! ## Governance Integration
//!
//! The Registries pallet is integrated with on-chain governance pallets to
//! allow registry administrators and delegates to propose changes, vote on
//! initiatives, or manage the registry in accordance with the collective decisions
//! of its members.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! - Creating a new registry for a community-driven project.
//! - Archiving, Restoring a registry that is to be stashed for a while.
//! - Revoking, Re-instating a registry that is no longer active or has violated terms of use.
//! - Adding delegates to a registry to ensure ongoing compliance with governance standards.
