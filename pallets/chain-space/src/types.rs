/// ## Fields
///
/// - `code`: The unique code or identifier for the space.

/// - `txn_capacity`: The maximum allowed transactions within the space. A value of zero denotes
///   unlimited capacity.
/// - `txn_count`: The current usage of the space's capacity.
/// - `approved`: Indicates whether the space has been approved by the appropriate governance body.
/// - `archive`: Indicates whether the space is currently archived.
